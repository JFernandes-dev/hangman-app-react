# Getting Started with Hangman-app

This project is made and maintained by Jennifer Fernandes

## What the project does and how to get help: 

This is a traditional hangman game without needing the slightly disturbing hangman image! The user has to guess the randomly generated word by clicking on the letters of the keyboard. The user can only guess a wrong letter 6 times before they lose. Whether they win or lose they can restart the game at the end. 

The user can also click the help button to find out the rules at any point in the game. The user should not choose any letter twice, whether correct or incorrect.

This project uses useState from React to save a number of variables in the game and passes props between components in order for them to sync to user interaction.

## To start the game:

1. Navigate to your terminal or command prompt
2. Ensure you are in the correct directory containing the hangman app
3. On the command line type 'npm install' to load the necessary data you need
4. This should take a few seconds. Once you get a success message you are then able to start the game. 
5. Do this by typing 'npm start' in your command line which will open the game in your browser.
